# CompressorGPT
In this project we use OPENAI's API to make a compressing tool. 
So basically we take OPENAI's API and make a tool(k/a CompressorGPT), where text when entered is compressed into a text file that when entered back into CompressorGPT gives back the same text. 
With the help of smart and intelligent prompt engineering, we can use CompressorGPT to save loads of space.
Because the new text generated by CompressorGPT is less than half the size of initial text.
